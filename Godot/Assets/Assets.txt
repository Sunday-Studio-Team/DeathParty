The Assets file should have generic assets that might not go anywhere. Likely we will put things such as fonts, audio files, etc here.
Additionally we can put specific asset files (such as large art sheets) that might not belong anywhere else.
Avoid putting specific (like a single image) art here that could be placed alongside the object that depends on it.
